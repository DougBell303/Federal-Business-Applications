Please select MP3 or WAV file.  Note: this demo oly supports these two formats, but [Azure Batch Speech to Text supports the following formats](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/batch-transcription-audio-data?tabs=portal#supported-audio-formats-and-codecs):
- WAV
- MP3
- OPUS/OGG
- FLAC
- WMA
- AAC
- ALAW in WAV container
- MULAW in WAV container
- AMR
- WebM
- M4A
- SPEEX

Once selected, click **Upload**.  The audio file is then uploaded as an attachment to a new item in your SharePoint list.  *Note: this is only required due to current [limitations](#limitations) with Azure Blob Storage connector in Power Apps.*

Behind the scenes, Power Automate executes a series of flows to generate the transcript (via Azure Batch Speech to Text services) and then load the transcript into Dataverse

### View Transcript
After the transcript is loaded into Dataverse, the transcript will appear in the app on the left hand side. You may need to refresh the app to see the latest data.

## Demo Transcript Admin App (model driven)

The other app exists mostly for developers, but might also prove useful for admins.  It gives you access to all three tables and the ability to view the additional metadata captured by Azure Speech to Text.

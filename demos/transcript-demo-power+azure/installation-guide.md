# Installation Guide
There are two versions of the solution: managed and unmanaged.  We **strongly** recommend you use the managed version if importing into an existing environment with other solutions.  If you want to customize the solution, you can use the unmanaged version or you can import that managed version and use an unmanaged solution to store your customiations.

Which ever version you use, the steps are basically the same:

1. Go to your environment
2. Click Solutions
3. Click Import Solution
4. Click Browse and select the file (managed or unmanaged)
5. Click Next
6. You will be prompted to update the connections. If none exist, you will need to create them.
